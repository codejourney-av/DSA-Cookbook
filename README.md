# üìñ My DSA Cookbook



Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Cookbook** ‚Äî a personal collection of Python implementations, notes, and examples covering fundamental concepts in computer science.
Think of it as my **recipe book** for solving problems efficiently and understanding the "why" behind every approach.

---

## üöÄ Purpose

This repository serves as:

* A **learning log** of my DSA journey.
* A **reference hub** for Python implementations.
* A place to solidify concepts by building them from scratch rather than relying solely on libraries.
* A stepping stone towards mastering **problem-solving skills** for technical interviews and real-world applications.

---

## üìö Table of Contents

Each topic has its own folder containing:

* Well-documented Python code.
* Explanations and notes on the concept.
* Time and space complexity analysis.

| #  | Data Structure / Topic |

| 01 | **Linked Lists**       |
| 02 | **Stacks & Queues**    |
| 03 | **Trees**              |
| 04 | **Hash Tables**        |
| 05 | **Graphs**             |
| 06 | **Heaps**              |
| 07 | **Sorting Algorithms** |

## üõ† Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Tools & Environment:** VS Code, Jupyter Notebook (for testing), Git for version control.

---

## üìà My Learning Approach

1. **Understand** the theory and use cases.
2. **Implement** the data structure from scratch.
3. **Analyze** performance in terms of time and space complexity.
4. **Refactor** for cleaner and more efficient solutions.
5. **Practice** with real-world problems and coding challenges.

---

## üîÆ Future Plans

* Add **algorithm-focused** sections (searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms).
* Include **visual explanations** for certain topics.
* Add **unit tests** to verify correctness.
* Explore **language-agnostic concepts** for broader understanding.
